    pakhawaj: "One of the major percussion instruments of Indian classical music. A bifacial cylindrical drum hollowed out of a block of wood. Right face and Left face is made up of sheet made from animal skin, which is stretched across both the side of the cylindrical drum. The Right face is called Syahi Pudi loaded with Black paste made with gum, soot, charcoal powder and iron filings and the left face is called Dhum Pudi. Fine wheat flour dough is applied on the left face (Dhum Pudi) before the performance and taken out immediately after that. Both the Pudis are tied to a strip called Gajra. Gajra (made by joining leather braces of animal skin) is fixed to the mouth of a drum with leather braces called Baddhi. These braces are tied among Syahi and Dhum Pudi by making 16 holes (Ghar) on both the side at equal distance. There are eight tuning blocks (Gatta), kept beneath each pair of leather bracing, used to tune Pakhawaj by moving them up and down. Normally tune can be controlled by striking a small steel hammer on the Gajra. Played with fingers and palms of both hands. It is also a Solo Instrument.",

    tabla: "Tabla is a percussion instrument which consists of a pair of drums. It has two single headed drums, with different shapes and sizes. The drum played with the right hand is called Dayan whereas the one played with the left hand is called Bayan (depends whether user is righty or lefty). Both drums are placed on ring shaped holders made of plant fibre covered with cloth, to balance them while playing. Dayan is made of wood while bayan is made of iron, copper, aluminum, steel or clay. Pudi is a sheet made from animal skin, which is stretched across both drums. Pudi is tied to a strip called Gajra. Gajra (made by joining leather braces of animal skin) is fixed to the mouth of a drum with leather braces called Baddhi. These braces are tied to another ring at the bottom of tabla and further tied to 16 holes (Ghar) at equal distance, which gives an equal balance to the instrument at all points. There are eight tuning blocks (Gatta), kept beneath each pair of leather bracing, used to tune tabla by moving them up and down. Syahi (seven centimetres in diameter) is a mixture of gum, soot, charcoal powder and iron filings, affixed centrally on Dayan and eccentrically on bayan. The range of tune depends on the size of the Dayan. Normally tune can be controlled by striking a small steel hammer on the Gajra. Dayan is tuned to the root note (Sa), on which the performance is based. ",
